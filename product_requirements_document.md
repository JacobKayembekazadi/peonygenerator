# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Feature Name: 3D Peony Garden Interactive Web App

---

## Problem Statement

Users who enjoy gardening, creativity, or relaxing visual experiences lack an accessible, interactive, and visually appealing way to design and arrange a virtual peony garden in 3D. Existing tools are either too complex, not visually engaging, or do not offer real-time, browser-based 3D interaction for casual users.

## User Stories

- **As a casual user**, I want to select a peony color and plant it in a 3D garden by clicking, so I can create my own unique flower arrangement.
- **As a creative user**, I want to see the flowers sway gently in the wind, so the garden feels alive and relaxing.
- **As a user**, I want to clear the garden with a single click, so I can start over easily.
- **As a user**, I want the application to work smoothly on my desktop or laptop browser without installing anything.

## Functional Requirements

1. **3D Scene Rendering**
    - Render a 3D ground plane, sky/background, and lighting using Three.js.
    - Display peony flowers as 3D models with petals, stem, and leaves.
2. **Color Selection**
    - Provide a palette of at least 5 peony colors as clickable swatches.
    - Visually indicate the currently selected color.
3. **Planting Peonies**
    - Allow users to plant a peony by clicking on the ground in the 3D scene.
    - Place the peony at the clicked location, using the selected color.
    - Each peony is a unique 3D object and can be planted multiple times.
4. **Clearing the Garden**
    - Provide a "Clear Garden" button to remove all peonies from the scene.
    - Properly dispose of 3D objects to free memory.
5. **Wind Animation**
    - Animate peonies with a gentle swaying effect to simulate wind.
6. **Responsive UI**
    - UI controls (color palette, clear button) are always visible and usable regardless of screen size.
7. **Camera Controls**
    - Allow users to rotate, zoom, and pan the camera using mouse/touch (OrbitControls).
8. **No Login or Account Required**
    - The app is fully anonymous and does not require user registration.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**
    - The app must load in under 3 seconds on a typical broadband connection.
    - Must support smooth interaction with up to 50 peonies in the scene without lag on modern browsers.
- **Accessibility:**
    - UI controls must be keyboard accessible and have sufficient color contrast.
    - All interactive elements must be clearly visible and labeled.
- **Security:**
    - No user data is collected or stored.
    - No external scripts except trusted CDNs (Three.js, Google Fonts).
- **Browser Compatibility:**
    - Must work on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari on desktop.
- **Reliability:**
    - The app should not crash or leak memory during normal use.

## Out of Scope (for MVP)

- Saving or exporting garden designs
- Mobile/touch-optimized UI (desktop only for MVP)
- User accounts, authentication, or personalization
- Sharing gardens on social media
- Advanced flower editing (e.g., resizing, moving, deleting individual peonies)
- Sound/music or background audio
- Persistent storage of garden state

## Success Metrics

- **Usage:** At least 100 unique users interact with the garden in the first month.
- **Performance:** 95% of users experience load times under 3 seconds.
- **Stability:** Less than 1% of sessions result in a crash or major bug.
- **User Satisfaction:** 80%+ positive feedback in user surveys or reviews.
- **Engagement:** Average session duration is at least 2 minutes.
